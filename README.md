The project contains simulations for https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19992 <br>
You will need basic Python packages for qubit-oscillator simulations like QuTip, SciPy, NumPy..<br>
The data for the figures are stored in the folder Paper_Data, generated in NA-QSP_sims.ipynb, plotted in Paper_Figures_NA-QSP.ipynb. <br>
All figures are stored in the folder Paper_Figures for the main text and Supp_Figures for the supplementary text.
